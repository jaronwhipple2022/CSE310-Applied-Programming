# Overview

The purpose of this project was to embed an interactive map into a website. It was a learning curve to learn a new software that is effective in displaying geographical information. The main focus was to learn how to properly display my own geographical information and link in into a user-friendly website.

A large portion of my hobbies and interests include following and studying maps. This was an effective way for me to cache information that I can reflect on, as well as share with others who have the same opportunity to hunt sheep as I did.

# Development Environment

ArcGIS is an online tool that allows users to map and share information. This software was the source of the map I created.
I wrote HTML and CSS in Visual Studio Code.

# Future Work

- Updated information: I am still currently hunting so in the future I will have more information to add. (and hopefully a picture of my ram!)
- Webpage responsiveness. Where my focus was on the map, I did not spend enough time making the website responsive to different screen sizes. This needs some work.
- My "Business" IdahoApex is growing. I would add in some links to my social media sites and my official website: idahoapex.com (still in progress) to direct people to look more into what I do.
