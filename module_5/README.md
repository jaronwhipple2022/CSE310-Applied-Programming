# Overview

This Java program is a file creator and viewer. The user can create a file name and text to insert into the file. They can then view a list of all files that have been created and open them to see their content. I recognize there is an obnoxious bug that causes the program to receive/execute display data funny. I believe this has something to do with the scanner. It is a problem that I unfortunately do not have time to fix at this time.

I wrote this program from complete scratch to build my knowledge in the Java language. I tried to include an example of all the basic programming concepts in order to practice them. This was a great opportunity for me to learn and demonstrate what I learned about the Java language.

# Development Environment

I wrote this program using Visual Studio Code with several extensions that allow Java to run. These extensions include: Maven for Java, Language Support for Java, Project Manager for Java, and Test Runner for Java. All GitHub uploads were also done through Visual Studio Code.

# Future Work

- First and formost I need to fix the bug of recieving and executing input.
- Something I would like to add is the ability to open an existing file and edit it, rather than just view it.
- I still feel a little unsure about how classes interact together. To better understand, I would like to break up my code into different classes for additional practice.
- I like things neat and tidy. I think it would be fun to add a more interactive/pretty user interface.
